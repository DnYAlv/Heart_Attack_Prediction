<h1>Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction</h1>
This problem was about prediction whether a person more likely has a higher chance to get heart attack or no.

This problem mainly a Classification task. Therefore, I will try to use Machine Learning model to classify this dataset for prediction.

The evaluation that will be used for future is mainly on F1-Score where other metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, or AUC can also be the metrics but not as our main focus.
